\section{Introduction}
This paper is about an academic project born to be an efficient solution for the CINI\footnote{Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale per l'Informatica} 2017 Challenge on smart cities illumination systems. In particular, the goal was to prototype and test a solution which was capable of (near) real-time data stream processing for monitoring records from streetlamps, lumen sensors co-located with the streetlamp itself and from traffic data produced by third-party APIs. We will explore this solution for the following use case: in a smart city context it is necessary to guarantee the maximum efficiency from lamps consumption while providing an optimal illumination within safety limits for pedestrians and drivers and according to local traffic intensity. To achieve that, it is necessary to project a grid of smart lamps capable of tuning their light level according to the right amount of energy necessary to provide city aware, safe and green consumption levels. This grid must be powered and managed via a reliable, highly available, processing-capable control system. Introducing Project Ember.
